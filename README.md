front end project for a fast food restaurant called PUTSO.

only front end technologies were used.

the reason back-end isn't being used is that it is a front end only project at my university.

link to the website : https://ubik69.github.io/frontEndDevelopment/

basic burger model were taken from a free to use website however, other models made using blender.

client-sided payment api were imported using paypal's api.

everything is working as it suppose to however I do not suggest not using any back-end technology for such e-commerce, it can cause major damages easily. For example, end users have access to the javascripts and can modify prices and add to their baskets as shown below:
